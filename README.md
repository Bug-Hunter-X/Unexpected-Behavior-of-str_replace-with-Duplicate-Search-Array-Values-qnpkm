This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in PHP's `str_replace` function. When using arrays for search and replace, duplicate values in the search array lead to only the first occurrence of each duplicate being replaced.  This can produce unexpected and hard-to-debug outcomes. The `bug.php` file shows the problematic code, and `bugSolution.php` offers a solution using a loop for more robust replacement.
